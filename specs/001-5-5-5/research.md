# Research: Claude Code Automated Restart System

## Windows Process Monitoring Solutions

### Decision: psutil + subprocess
**Rationale**:
- `psutil` provides cross-platform process monitoring with Windows-specific capabilities
- `subprocess` offers reliable process control and output capture
- Native Python libraries minimize external dependencies
- Proven stability for long-running monitoring applications

**Alternatives considered**:
- `pywin32`: Windows-specific but adds complexity
- `wmi`: Powerful but overkill for simple process monitoring
- Direct Windows API calls: Too low-level for maintenance

## Terminal Output Monitoring Patterns

### Decision: Real-time stdout/stderr capture with buffering
**Rationale**:
- `subprocess.Popen` with `stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE` enables real-time capture
- Line-by-line processing prevents memory buildup
- Buffer management handles high-volume output
- Non-blocking I/O prevents deadlocks

**Alternatives considered**:
- File tailing: Less reliable than direct process capture
- Windows event monitoring: Doesn't capture application text output
- Screen scraping: Fragile and performance-heavy

## Text Pattern Detection for Limit Messages

### Decision: Compiled regex patterns with configurable detection
**Rationale**:
- Regex compilation improves performance for repeated matching
- Pattern configuration allows adaptation to message format changes
- Multiple pattern support handles different limit message variations
- Case-insensitive matching increases reliability

**Alternatives considered**:
- String contains matching: Too rigid for message variations
- Natural language processing: Overkill and resource-intensive
- Fixed string patterns: Brittle to format changes

## Precise Timing for 5-Hour Periods

### Decision: datetime-based scheduling with persistence
**Rationale**:
- `datetime.datetime` and `timedelta` provide precise timing
- Timezone-aware calculations prevent daylight saving issues
- State persistence enables recovery from system restarts
- Countdown display provides user feedback

**Alternatives considered**:
- `time.sleep()`: Blocks execution and not resumable
- Operating system schedulers: External dependencies
- Simple counters: Lose accuracy over long periods

## State Persistence Across System Restarts

### Decision: JSON configuration files with atomic writes
**Rationale**:
- Human-readable format aids debugging
- Atomic file operations prevent corruption
- Lightweight compared to databases
- Easy backup and configuration management

**Alternatives considered**:
- SQLite database: Overhead for simple state storage
- Windows Registry: Platform-specific and complex
- Pickle files: Binary format complicates debugging

## Claude Code Integration Strategy

### Decision: Command-line invocation with configurable parameters
**Rationale**:
- CLI invocation maintains separation of concerns
- Parameter configuration enables different startup modes
- Environment variable support for authentication
- Working directory control for project context

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct API integration: Not available for Claude Code
- Browser automation: Fragile and resource-intensive
- File system monitoring: Indirect and unreliable

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Decision: Graceful degradation with comprehensive logging
**Rationale**:
- Exception handling prevents crashes during monitoring
- Retry mechanisms handle transient failures
- Structured logging enables troubleshooting
- Graceful shutdown preserves state consistency

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fail-fast approach: Reduces reliability for long-running operation
- Silent error handling: Complicates debugging
- External monitoring services: Adds complexity and dependencies

## Task Completion Detection

### Decision: Output pattern analysis with timeout safeguards
**Rationale**:
- Monitor Claude Code output for completion indicators
- Timeout mechanisms prevent indefinite waiting
- User-configurable completion patterns
- Graceful interruption prevents token waste

**Alternatives considered**:
- Process monitoring only: Doesn't detect task completion
- User manual confirmation: Defeats automation purpose
- Fixed timing: Unreliable for variable task durations

## Configuration Management

### Decision: Hierarchical configuration with validation
**Rationale**:
- JSON/YAML configuration files for user customization
- Default values ensure system works out-of-box
- Configuration validation prevents runtime errors
- Hot reload capability for configuration updates

**Alternatives considered**:
- Command-line arguments only: Limited flexibility
- Environment variables: Difficult for complex configuration
- Hard-coded values: No user customization

## Research Conclusion

All technical unknowns have been resolved with concrete implementation decisions. The chosen technologies and patterns provide a robust foundation for the automated restart system while maintaining simplicity and reliability for long-running operation on Windows systems.
