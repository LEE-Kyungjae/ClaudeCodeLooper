**Feature Branch**: `001-5-5-5`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "˜” t\ÜTÜ| ¬Èä 4\<\ äÜ ä‰X” \ø¨D Ìäp|. ¬ Ä°X½tà üÄXŒ ¬©`½° 5ÜÈä ¬t x¬”p t 0øÐ 5Ü ¬(” M¤¸| ÀXt 5Ü ÄÐ äÜ t\ÜTÜÐŒ …9D ´¬t ÀJDL ÝXàˆ´. \, …9D ä‰ˆ”p  pD äð0Ð ‰D H”t H0L8Ð tù€„X l¸ \ D”`ƒ<\ ô„.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer needs to continuously use Claude Code for extended development work that exceeds the 5-hour usage limit. Instead of manually monitoring for limit notifications and manually restarting after the 5-hour cooldown period, they want an automated system that detects when Claude Code hits its usage limit, waits for the limit to reset, and automatically restarts Claude Code with predefined commands to continue their work seamlessly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Claude Code is running and reaches its 5-hour usage limit, **When** the limit message appears in the terminal, **Then** the system detects this message and begins a 5-hour countdown timer
2. **Given** the 5-hour waiting period has elapsed, **When** the timer completes, **Then** the system automatically launches Claude Code with the user's predefined commands
3. **Given** Claude Code is executing a task, **When** the task is in progress, **Then** the system ensures the task completes before allowing any restart cycle to begin
4. **Given** the system has completed one restart cycle, **When** Claude Code hits the usage limit again, **Then** the system repeats the detection and restart process indefinitely
5. **Given** the system is monitoring Claude Code output, **When** limit detection text appears, **Then** the system logs the detection time and begins the appropriate waiting period

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the system fails to detect the limit message due to unexpected text formatting?
- How does the system handle if Claude Code crashes or is manually terminated during operation?
- What occurs if the user manually restarts Claude Code while the system is in its waiting period?
- How does the system behave if multiple limit messages appear in quick succession?
- What happens if the system is restarted while in the middle of a 5-hour waiting period?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST continuously monitor Claude Code terminal output for usage limit notifications
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect when Claude Code displays a 5-hour usage limit message [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact text pattern of limit messages not specified]
- **FR-003**: System MUST begin a precisely timed 5-hour waiting period when a limit is detected
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically restart Claude Code with predefined commands after the waiting period expires
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure that ongoing Claude Code tasks complete before initiating any restart cycle
- **FR-006**: System MUST operate continuously, repeating the detection-wait-restart cycle indefinitely
- **FR-007**: System MUST work reliably on Windows operating systems
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to configure the commands that will be executed when Claude Code restarts
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide logging of detection events, waiting periods, and restart activities
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle interruptions gracefully and resume monitoring after system restarts [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: persistence requirements for waiting periods across system reboots not specified]
- **FR-011**: System MUST differentiate between temporary Claude Code pauses and actual usage limit hits
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent premature termination of Claude Code tasks to avoid token waste

### Key Entities
- **Monitoring Session**: Represents an active monitoring period of Claude Code terminal output, including start time, current status, and detection history
- **Limit Detection Event**: Represents a detected usage limit notification, including detection timestamp, matched text pattern, and subsequent actions taken
- **Restart Command Configuration**: Represents the user-defined commands and parameters that should be executed when Claude Code is restarted
- **Waiting Period**: Represents an active 5-hour countdown period, including start time, remaining duration, and completion callback
- **Task Completion Monitor**: Represents the mechanism for ensuring Claude Code tasks finish before restart cycles begin
